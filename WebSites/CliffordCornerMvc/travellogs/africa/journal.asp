			<p><em>September 3 <sup>rd</sup>:</em></p>
			<p>Running late, thanks to the N Juda (ok, really cause Jed and I
			are slow), we get to the airport about an hour before our flight. We get through security with enough
			time to spare to have a couple of beers before getting on our flight.</p>

			<p><em>September 4 <sup>th</sup> &ndash; 5 <sup>th</sup>:</em> Amsterdam!</p>
			<p>Ouch, jet lagged. We get in around lunchtime after a rather uneventful overnight flight. We attempt
			to check out the town, but end up spending the most of the day hanging out at various <em>"alternative"</em>
			bars (I think we managed to find every gay bar in Amsterdam) and resting/drinking/bathroom breaks. On
			our way to dinner, we ran into an old colleague of Rich and Don's who was also in town - what a small
			world (we had another small world encounter on this trip as well, stay tuned).</p>
			
			<p>Our second day in Amsterdam was a little bit more eventful. We strolled around the city, checked
			out some of the landmarks, and sampled some of the cities fine cuisine and beverages. We walked around
			the Vondelpark, checked out Old Town, visited the Rijksmuseum, saw Anne Frank's house, drank beer, and
			ended the day with a quick stroll through the Red Light District. Exhausted, we crashed pretty early.</p>

			<p><em>September 6 <sup>th</sup>:</em> We jumped on a plane headin to Kilimanjaro airport. The flight
			pretty much took all day, and involved several rounds of euchre and drinks. We flew over the Austrian
			Alps, then over Greece and the Mediterranean, then the Sahara desert (the light radiating from the desert
			was so intense, it made the windows hot to touch), and finally landed at Kilimanjaro airport that evening.
			We met our drivers Sahaba and Frank and spent a night in the Ilburo Lodge in Arusha.</p>
			
			<p><em>September 7 <sup>th</sup> &ndash; 8 <sup>th</sup>:</em>
			<a href="tarangire.asp">Tarangire &amp; Tamarind Camp</a></p>
			
			<p>Our first game drive and park, and we got early excitment from some
			<a href="picture.asp?img=012.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">zebra's</a> at 200 yards! Little did we know
			that we would be up close and personal with the wildlife for the rest of the trip. Tarangire is known for it's
			<a href="picture.asp?img=025.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">elephant population</a>, and it didn't disappoint.
			It was amazing to see Elephants in the wild, close,
			<a href="picture.asp?img=036.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">right next to our car</a>.
			We also saw <a href="picture.asp?img=031.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">giraffes</a>,
			<a href="picture.asp?img=004.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">wilderbeast</a>,
			<a href="picture.asp?img=027.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">dik-dik's</a>, warthogs, and waaaayyyy off in the
			distance, <a href="picture.asp?img=050.jpg&album=tarangire&title=Tarangire">a pair of lions</a>.</p>

			<p>Tamarind camp was awesome. It was semi-rustic in that there was no running
			water or electricity. But we were treated like royalty (we were pretty much treated like kings &amp;
			queens the entire trip). We had an amazing chef, and gracious host and waiter, and friendly Masai
			to guard us at night and fill our shower buckets with hot water. We spent our days driving around Tarangire
			and our evenings drinking Safari beer and chatting around the fire.</p>
			
			<p><em>September 9 <sup>th</sup> &ndash; 12 <sup>th</sup>:</em>
			<a href="ngorongoro.asp">Ngorongoro Crater</a></p>
			<p>The first half of our Ngorongoro experience was spent hiking the periphery of
			the park. We spent two and half day's hiking across the Bul Bul depression to the Empakaii crater.
			The highlight was visiting a <a href="picture.asp?img=036.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">Masai school</a>
			at the village of Bulati. There are four teachers for over three hundred students, and we got to hear
			them sing and see their classrooms. For me, it was an eye-opening experience, and made me truly
			appreciate the opportunities that I got growing up in the US.</p>
			
			<p>We also got to see an <a href="picture.asp?img=021.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">amazing sunset</a>
			over the the Bul Bul depression, a look inside one of the Masai dung huts, a beautiful
			<a href="picture.asp?img=020.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">Moon rise</a>, and the
			<a href="picture.asp?img=045.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">pink flamingo's</a> inside the Empakaii crater.
			I truly enjoyed the hiking opportunity, and even the chilly nights. We also had a great Masai ranger named Saipi
			Moini who gave us the opportunity to get a glimpse of his culture.</p>
			
			<p>The later half of our Ngorongoro experience was spent visiting the Ngorongoro crater.
			Thanks to our new friend Saipi, we were able to get through the gates half an hour before all the rest of
			the tourists. Within the first hour of our drive, we saw a <em>huge</em>
			<a href="picture.asp?img=053.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">elephant</a>, which spooked a couple of
			cheetah's that where hanging our along the road. The
			<a href="picture.asp?img=054.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">cheetah's</a> then proceeded
			to stalk some gazelle. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your viewpoint), the gazelle got spooked
			and ran away. We would see these same cheetah's later in the day, they were 
			<a href="picture.asp?img=077.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">resting</a> after catching some prey. We
			also got to see a <a href="picture.asp?img=073.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">rhino</a> up close and
			personal &ndash; it crossed the road right in front of us. We also saw some
			<a href="picture.asp?img=066.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">hyena's</a>, some
			<a href="picture.asp?img=069.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">water buffalo</a>,
			some <a href="picture.asp?img=061.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">hippo's lounging</a> around, and some
			<a href="picture.asp?img=070.jpg&album=ngorongoro&title=Ngorongoro">wily wazungo's</a> in the wild. All in all,
			we got to see some amazing wildlife in the crater.</p>

			<p><em>September 13 <sup>th</sup> &ndash; 15 <sup>th</sup>:</em> <a href="serengeti.asp">Serengeti</a>:</p>
			<p>Next up, the Serengeti plain. We drove from the Ngorongoro crater, through the Olduvai Gorge, to
			the Serengeti savanna. We stayed in one of the luxurious places I have ever been in. While being
			<a href="picture.asp?img=016.jpg&album=serengeti&title=Serengeti">wine and dined</a> at the Kirawira lodge,
			we got the opportunity to see a
			<a href="picture.asp?img=003.jpg&album=serengeti&title=Serengeti">leapord</a>, more
			<a href="picture.asp?img=002.jpg&album=serengeti&title=Serengeti">giraffe</a>, some
			<a href="picture.asp?img=013.jpg&album=serengeti&title=Serengeti">hippo's up close</a>, a
			<a href="picture.asp?img=001.jpg&album=serengeti&title=Serengeti">Genet Cat</a>, and finally, some
			<a href="picture.asp?img=019.jpg&album=serengeti&title=Serengeti">lion's up close</a>.
			The Serengeti is a great park, and I can't think of a better way to end our Tanzania leg of our safari. Here we
			said goodbye to our drivers Shaba and Frank, and headed off to Kenya and the Masai Mara.</p>
			<p><em>September 16 <sup>th</sup>:</em> Another travel day. We took off from a little dirt paved runway in
			the Serengeti park, flew over the Ngorongoro crater &ndash; a crazy, bumpy, and nerve racking flight for all
			&ndash; and arrived in Arusha. From Arusha, we jumped into a van &ndash; all 9 of us in one van, nice and
			tight &ndash; had a chinese lunch, then jumped into a bus for the long haul to Nariobi. And boy was it a long,
			hot haul. About six hours of driving, plus time for getting across the Kenya/Tanzania border. Once in Nariobi,
			we basically hid out in our hotel, the Intercontinental (or the one that got bombed &ndash; yeah, real safe).</p>

			<p><em>September 17 <sup>th</sup> &ndash; 19 <sup>th</sup>:</em>
			<a href="default.asp">Masai Mara</a></p>
			<p>Time to see some serious wildlife. In the fall, the wilderbeast migrate to the Masai Mara region
			(dubbed the "Great Migration"). There were
			<a href="picture.asp?img=043.jpg&album=mara&title=Masi Mara">thousands of wilderbeast</a>
			and zebra's all across the the african savanna. And hunting the wilderbeast,
			<a href="picture.asp?img=010.jpg&album=mara&title=Masi Mara">Lions</a>, and lots of them. We ran into a pride
			of twenty six lions about a mile outside our camp. We also saw a mother cheetah with three adolescent cubs.
			These cheetah's would <a href="picture.asp?img=016.jpg&album=mara&title=Masi Mara">jump up onto your car</a>
			to get a better view of the plains, while the tourists cower in their seats. We also saw lots of topi,
			<a href="picture.asp?img=033.jpg&album=mara&title=Masi Mara">standing tall</a> keeping and eye out for preditors.
			And, two of the biggest highlights of the entire trip, we saw wilderbeast
			<a href="picture.asp?img=048.jpg&album=mara&title=Masi Mara">crossing the mara</a> (getting eaten by crocidiles)
			and the mother cheetah chasing a bush buck toward our jeep.</p>
			
			<p>While in the Masai Mara, we stayed at
			<a href="http://www.kenya.za.net/little-governor-camp.html">Little Governor's Camp</a>, a beautiful camp that circles
			a watering hole. We would sleep to the sounds of hippo's grunting and baboons hooting. Jed woke me one night, and
			pointed out a hippo about four feet from our tent munching on grass. There were also
			<a href="picture.asp?img=003.jpg&album=mara&title=Masi Mara">tame warthogs</a> that walked around the camp. And
			then there were the meals, wow, I don't eat like that often.</p>
			
			<p><em>September 20 <sup>th</sup></em>:
			<p>We left the Masai Mara and started our arduous trip back to California. After about 36 hours of pretty
			much continuous travel (with layovers in Nariobi and Amsterdam), we finally land in the Bay Area. Probably,
			no, definitely the longest trip I have ever taken (ok, I probably took longer flights when I was a baby, but
			I don't remember).</p>
	
			<p><em>WHAT A TRIP!!!</em>
