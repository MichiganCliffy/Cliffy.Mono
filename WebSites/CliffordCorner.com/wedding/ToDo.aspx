<h2>Around San Francisco</h2>

<a name="alcatraz" title="Alcatraz"></a><h3>Alcatraz</h3>
<p>Book early!!!! This is a classic destination, and it fills up quickly. For those who have extra time, take the <a href="http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/alcatraz/tours.asp#Night" target="_blank" title="Alcatraz night tour">night tour</a>,
there is nothing more spooky than getting locked in solitary confinement in the dark. This is a very cool tour.</p>

<a name="fishermanswharf" title="Fisherman's Wharf & Ghirardelli Square"></a><h3>Fisherman's Wharf & Ghirardelli Square</h3>
<p>If you've never been to San Francisco, you have to visit this area. You can pretty much see everything there is to see in a couple of hours, and I would definitely not plan on more than 1/2 a day walking around. Some high-lights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check out the sea lions at Pier 39. Follow your noise and ears to find them (they are nosy and very smelly).</li>
<li>Get a hot fudge sundae at the <a href="http://sftravelguide.com/attractions/ghirardelli-square.php" target="_blank" title="Ghirardelli Soda Fountain">Ghirardelli Soda Fountain</a>.</li>
<li>After stuffing yourself with ice cream, grab an Irish Coffee at the historic <a href="http://www.thebuenavista.com/index2.html" target="_blank" title="Buena Vista Cafe">Buena Vista Cafe</a>.
But watch out, they sneak up on you.</li>
<li>Check out the old ships. Some times they are open to the public and you can walk around them.</li>
<li>If you feel like spending some money, the Aquarium has a pretty decent exhibit.</li>
<li>Boat tours around the Bay can be booked here. Not sure this is worth it, but my folks seemed to enjoy it.</li>
<li>A short walk from Fisherman's Wharf is the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombard_Street_(San_Francisco)" title="crooked street">crooked street</a>," otherwise known as Lombard St. I would highly recommend NOT trying to drive it as traffic can be nasty. My buddy Nick lives on this street, and there is a constant stream of tourists attempting to drive down this street. Just walk to it and check it out.</li>
</ul>

<a name="muirwoods" title="Muir Woods, Mt. Tam, and Golden Gate Recreation Area"></a><h3>Muir Woods, Mt. Tam, and Golden Gate Recreation Area</h3>
<p>Just across the Golden Gate bridge (north) are parks, and we're talking big parks. The area just to the north of San Francisco,
and hugging the coast is the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/" target="_blank" title="Golden Gate National Recreation Area">Golden Gate National Recreation Area</a>.
There are tons of hiking trails that loop around hidden little beaches and coves. Lots of wild life too, from deer, to hawks, and if you are lucky a mountain lion or bobcat.</p>

<p>The highest point of this area is <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=471" target="_blank" title="Mt. Tamalpais">Mt. Tamalpais</a>
(or Tam). You can drive to the top and get some fantastic views of San Francisco and the Bay. There are also tons of hiking trails that
loop around the mountain.</p>

<p>Nestled just at the base of Mt. Tam is <a href="http://www.nps.gov/muwo/" target="_blank" title="Muir Woods">Muir Woods</a>,
one of my favorite places to visit. You can hike around these trees all day, and feel like you've been taken back to the time of dinosaurs.
These trees are older than the United States, most are hundreds of years old.</p>

<p>For a possible side hike, head to the <a href="http://www.touristclubsf.org/" target="_blank" title="Tourist Club">Tourist Club</a>
just above Muir Woods, for some beer. Not always open, so check ahead of time.</p>

<a name="tiburon" title="Bike to Tiburon"></a><h3>Bike to Tiburon (Across the Bridge)</h3>
<p>There are multiple places to rent bikes around the city
(<a href="http://www.blazingsaddles.com" target="_blank">www.blazingsaddles.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.baycitybike.com" target="_blank">www.baycitybike.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.thebikehut.com" target="_blank">www.thebikehut.com</a>).</p>

<p>The city in general is very bike friend. One of the best routes is to bike north across the Golden Gate bridge, through Sausalito, to Tiburon. Then take the ferry from Tiburon back across the bay to Fisherman's Wharf. This is a fun 1/2 a day activity that really gives you a feel of the Bay. While at Tiburon, grab a burger and beer at <a href="http://www.samscafe.com/" target="_blank">Sam's</a>.</p>

<a name="goldengatepark" title="Golden Gate Park"></a><h3>Golden Gate Park</h3>
<p>The Golden Gate Park is huge, and there is tons to see here. Some high-lights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.conservatoryofflowers.org/" target="_blank" title="Conservatory of Flowers">Conservatory of Flowers</a>.
Close to the Haight Ashbury district, and well worth a visit. Really cool displays.</li>
<li>Walk around the Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum.</li>
<li>Check out the de Young Museum (you can buy a ticket that will get you into both the de Young and Legion of Honour museams).</li>
<li>If you can stand the lines, the new Academy of Sciences. This has just re-opened, and the lines are crazy. It's supposed to be amazing, but I have not had the chance to visit it yet.</li>
<li>Have tea in the Japanese Tea Gardens.</li>
<li>Walk to Ocean Beach and have a beer at the Beach Chalet. You'll walk past the Bison's, some old windmills, and lots of ponds and other random stuff (like a golf course, archery field, fly fishing casting pools, boche ball courts, polo fields, the list goes on).</li>
<li>Check out where the 49ers used to play at Kezar Stadium.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" title="back to the top">(top)</a></div>

<a name="neighborhoods" title="Check out the Neighborhoods"></a><h3>Check out the Neighborhoods</h3>
<p>San Francisco is made up of multiple, unique, neighborhoods. Some of the most popular are:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Beach (Italian District). The high-light of North Beach is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coit_Tower" target="_blank" title="Coit Tower">Coit Tower</a>.
I think this is well worth a visit, the view's are killer. Visiting North Beach can be combined with the Fisherman's Wharf trip. There are great bars and restuarants here.</li>
<li>Chinatown. Lots of unique sights and smells as you walk through this cramped part of San Francisco.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haight-Ashbury" target="_blank" title="Haight Ashbury">Haight Ashbury</a>. Birth place of the hippie movement. Combine this with a visit to Golden Gate Park</li>
<li>The Mission. Hispanic part of town, lots of fantastic restaurant's and bars.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" title="back to the top">(top)</a></div>

<a name="presidio" title="Presidio"></a><h3>Presidio</h3>
<p>The remains of the military presences in San Francisco, this is now all run by the national park system. Some of the high lights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.famsf.org/legion/index.asp" target="_blank" title="Legion of Honor Museum">Legion of Honor Museum</a>.
A pretty cool art museum, with some fantastic views of the city and Golden Gate bridge.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park.asp?park=14" target="_blank" title="Crissy Field">Crissy Field</a>.
A good way to kill a couple of hours. Walk along the beach and look out at the Golden Gate.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park.asp?park=87" target="_blank" title="Sutru Heights and Baths">Sutru Heights and Baths</a>. Way back in the early 1900's there was this massive pool system right on the edge of the ocean. Couple of earthquakes later, you can walk amongst the ruins. You can walk along the cliffs from Sutro to the Legion of Honor – some of the best Golden Gate scenic points are along this walk.</li>
</ul>

<a name="civiccenter" title="Civic Center"></a><h3>City Hall & the Asian Art Museum</h3>
<p>Hang out with Gavin at City Hall or check out one of the largest collections of Asian art outside of Asia at the
<a href="http://www.asianart.org/" target="_blank" title="Asian Art Museum">Asian Art Museum</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" title="back to the top">(top)</a></div>

<a name="winecountry" title="Wine Country"></a><h3>Wine Country</h3>
<p>For those of you staying longer, or have already done the San Francisco scene, I would highly recommend wine country. I would recommend Sonoma over Napa Valley, as it tends to be more low key, and lest touristy. Drive down Dry Creek Rd and stop to drink some of the fantastic Zin's from the Dry Creek valley.</p>
